# Interactive Maps with Folium!
Sophie Spiliotopoulos 
IDCE 30274 Lab 6

This tutorial uses a Python library called [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), which builds on a common web mapping javascript library called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
This lab works through creating a new dataframe using pandas, creating interactive chlorpleth and point maps, and discusses when to use chloropleth maps. 
The script for this lab  can be found in the attached Colab notebook.
